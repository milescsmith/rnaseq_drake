## Description
Where these samples came from.  Type of data.  How were the samples processed?  What machines used?  Raw data converted to form for analysis using SOFTWARE (VERSION).  Custom software (repository, commit used).

Files in the project directory are sorted into the following subdirectories:
- `directory_1`: what is in here, what is it used for
- `directory_2`: more stuff
- `code_dir_1`: this code is used specifically for...

## Usage

If I need to reproduce this data, how can I run the scripts here?  What docker container?  What commands?

(Note: is there anything special necessary to run this?  Lots of RAM?  A GPU?)
